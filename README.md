## Specifications
#An approach to producing effective design and technical specifications

Effective specification documents can make the development process efficient and effective.
Before any code is created, you should have a clear idea of what has to be built.
We use the two steps of VALIDATION and VERIFICATION: 
Validation: Am I building the right thing?
Verification: Am I building the thing right?

Some of the proceses are manual and there is huge benefit in the thought processes required in drawing and writing that can help you identify issues in advance, thereby avoiding being trapped in flows that cannot be resolved and having to start again.
